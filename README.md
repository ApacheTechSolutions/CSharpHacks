# CSharpHacks #

A repository to contain all of the C# Hacks you've ever thought of, anything that makes your coding life easier

In particular, I like nice, generic extension methods that will take wrap up tedious bits of code you need to write all the time.  

Some examples of hacks included already:

## Hacks for Specfic Types ##

* IDictionary - transform a dictionary into a look-up function with a default value
* Integer - TryParse & error check wrapped into a handy extension methods

## Code Structure hacks ##

* Map - like a Select in LINQ, but applies to the whole array, not just an element at a time
* Alt - an array of functions, which will be tried, one after the other, until one gives a value
* Fork - process a single data item in multiple ways, then return all  processed values to an aggregator function
* IfElse - Specify two functions and a condition, based on that condition either the first or second function will be executed


Please contribute anything you find useful.  Our mission here is to save time when coding C# so we can spend a lot more time being lazy.
